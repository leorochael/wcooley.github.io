## Fix Dreadful Truncated File Names

As people use Apache to anonymously serve files, more and more are we plagued
with truncated file names in the listing.  You can usually see the file name if
you mouse over the index link.  Here's the way to configure it to list
variable-length file names:

```
<IfModule mod_autoindex.c>
    # FancyIndexing is whether you want fancy directory indexing or standard
    #
    IndexOptions FancyIndexing NameWidth=*

    # ...
</IfModule>
```

## Filter Log Entries

You can use the `SetEnvIf` entry, along with the `CustomLog` directive, to
filter unnecessary junk out of the logs.  I used to do this in post-processing
as part of the log rotation, but it's easier to do it here.  Here's a sample:

```
SetEnvIf Request_URI "default\.ida" filtered-log
SetEnvIf Request_URI "root\.exe" filtered-log
SetEnvIf Request_URI "server-status" filtered-log
SetEnvIf Request_URI "cmd\.exe" filtered-log
SetEnvIf Remote_Addr x.x.x.x filtered-log      # My monitoring host, which generates a lot of misleading log entries
SetEnvIf Remote_Addr 127.0.0.1 filtered-log

LogFormat "%V %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" vcommon
CustomLog /var/log/httpd/virtual_log vcommon env=!filtered-log
```

## Empty Directory Listings in CentOS 5 / Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5

Upon upgrading to CentOS5 and (mostly) successfully migrating my Apache 2.0
*httpd.conf* to 2.2 by merging with the installed configuration file, I was
most perplexed to find that all of my directory listings generated by
*mod_autoindex* were empty--as if the directories contained no files.  After
further review, I discovered this entry:

```
IndexIgnore .??* *~ *
```

The last "*****" indicates that all normal files should be ignored.  I removed
that and files suddenly appeared again.
