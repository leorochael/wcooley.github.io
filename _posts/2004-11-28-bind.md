# BIND Notes

## Determining BIND Version Number

The BIND version number is published as a **TXT** record in class **CHAOS**
named **version.bind.**.  An example `dig` command to query `ns1.example.com`:

```
dig -t txt -c CH version.bind. @ns1.example.com
```

## Obscuring or Controlling Version Information

The version can be set in `named.conf` in the `options` section:

```
options {
    version "Foo Version";
};
```

BIND ACLs can also be employed to limit who can query the **bind** zone:

```
acl "trusted"   {
    {127.0.0/8; };
};

zone "bind" chaos {
    type master;
    file "/var/named/bind";
    allow-query { trusted; };
    allow-transfer { none; };
};
```

And the file `/var/named/bind` needs to be created:

```
TTL 1D
$ORIGIN bind.
@       1D  CHAOS SOA   localhost.      root.localhost. (
                        1
                        3H
                        1H
                        1W
                        1D  )
        CHAOS  NS       localhost.
```

Note that I can't actually get this to work with BIND 9.2.0.
